Hello World Python application with a REST API and a simple OpenAPI Specification (openapi.json)


Explanation:

The app.py file defines a simple Flask app with a single route / that returns a JSON response with the message "Hello, world!".
The openapi.json file defines the OpenAPI specification for the API. It includes information about the title, version, and paths available in the API.
Each path has an operation defined (in this case, only GET).
The operation has a summary describing its functionality and a response object.
The response object specifies the expected content type (application/json) and schema of the response data.
This example uses basic JSON schema with a single property message.
Additional Notes:

This example uses Flask for simplicity, but you can use other frameworks like FastAPI or Django for more complex APIs.
You can adjust the openapi.json file to include additional information about your API, such as security requirements, additional paths, and operation parameters.
