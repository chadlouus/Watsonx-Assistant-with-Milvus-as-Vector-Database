## Integrating your Gradio API into a Watson Assistant Chatbot

How you can integrate your Gradio API into a Watson Assistant chatbot to answer user questions:

**1. Create a Watson Assistant Skill:**

* Head to the IBM Cloud console and create a new Watson Assistant resource.
* Follow the steps to create a new skill and choose "Dialog" as the authoring experience.
* Start building your skill by defining intents and dialog nodes.

**2. Design Intents and Dialog Nodes:**

* Define an intent for each type of question you want your chatbot to answer. For example, you could have intents for "Ask a medical question", "Ask about symptoms", or "Get information on a medication".
* Under each intent, create dialog nodes that capture the user's specific question. You can use entities to extract relevant information like keywords or specific details.

**3. Integrate the API call:**

* Within your dialog nodes, use the "Actions" feature to call your Gradio API endpoint.
* You can use Watson Assistant's built-in HTTP Request action to send the user's question to your API endpoint. For example:
python
from gradio_client import Client

client = Client("https://watsonx-medical.16jc1w8uq8wb.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud/")
result = client.predict(
        "Howdy!", # str in 'message' Textbox component
        api_name="/predict"
)
print(result)

* Pass the user's question as the input to the API (e.g., as the "message" field).

**4. Process the API response:**

* Configure your dialog node to capture the response from your API. You can access the response data using variables like `$api_response`.
* Depending on the format of your API response, you might need to parse or manipulate the data to extract the answer.

**5. Respond to the user:**

* Use the "Text Response" or "Conditional Response" options to craft a response for the user based on the extracted answer.
* You can personalize the response by including the user's name or tailoring the answer to their specific question.

**6. Test and refine:**

* Test your chatbot with various questions and ensure it's providing accurate and helpful answers.
* Refine your dialog nodes, intents, and API calls based on user feedback and the performance of your chatbot.

**Demo Chatbot Example:**

Here's a simplified example of a dialog node that calls your Gradio API:

**Intent:** Ask_Medical_Question

**Dialog Node:** Get_Medical_Answer

* **Conditions:**
    * User input matches the #Ask_Medical_Question intent.
* **Actions:**
    * Send HTTP request to "/predict" endpoint of your Gradio API.
    * Pass the user's input as the "message" parameter.
    * Store the API response in the `$api_response` variable.
* **Then:**
    * Extract the answer from `$api_response` (based on your specific API format).
    * Respond to the user with the answer, personalized with their name ("Hi [User Name], %s" % extracted_answer).

Remember, this is just a starting point, and you might need to adjust it based on your specific API and desired functionality.

**Additional Tips:**

* Use context variables to store information across different dialog nodes.
* Consider using Watson Assistant's built-in NLP capabilities for improved question understanding.
* Explore the various response options in Watson Assistant to create engaging and informative interactions.

By following these steps and customizing them to your specific needs, you can create a Watson Assistant chatbot that leverages your Gradio API to answer user questions effectively.
