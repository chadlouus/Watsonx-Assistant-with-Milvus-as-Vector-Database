# Watson Assistant with WatsonX Medical

First let us create a simple notebook to just test our API, if is working.
We would like use Jupyter Notebook in Visual Studio Code.

To create a new Jupyter Notebook in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

2. Click on the "Extensions" icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window (it looks like a square with four smaller squares inside) or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`.

3. Make sure the Jupyter extension is installed. If not, search for "Jupyter" in the search bar, find the Jupyter extension by Microsoft, and click on the Install button.

4. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette.

5. Type "Jupyter" in the Command Palette search bar, and select "Jupyter: Create New Blank Jupyter Notebook" from the dropdown list. This will create a new Jupyter Notebook with a `.ipynb` file extension.

6. A new tab will open with an empty Jupyter Notebook. You can start adding code and markdown cells by clicking the `+` button in the toolbar or by using the "Insert cell" button (it looks like a blue rectangle with a plus sign) that appears when you hover over the space between cells.

7. To run a code cell, click on the cell and press `Shift+Enter`. The output will appear below the cell.

8. To save the notebook, press `Ctrl+S` or click on "File" in the top menu and then "Save As" to choose the location and file name for your notebook.

Now you have created and started working on a new Jupyter Notebook in Visual Studio Code.

In particular we have created for you this notebook of test here
[API-Test-WatsonX.ipynb](./API-Test-WatsonX.ipynb)
If the latest cell ran well you will get something like this

For the benchmarking we execute the folloging code

and also we ran the application on the Code Engine
