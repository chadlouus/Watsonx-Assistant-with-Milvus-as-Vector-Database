# Building a Watson Assistant with a Simple Webhook: Step-by-Step Guide

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating a Watson Assistant with a simple webhook. A webhook is a mechanism that allows you to call an external program based on an event in your program. This can be useful for validating information, interacting with external web services, sending requests to external applications, triggering SMS notifications, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- An IBM Cloud account
- Watson Assistant service provisioned in your IBM Cloud account

## Step 1: Defining the Webhook

To define a webhook, you need to specify the URL for the external application to which you want to send HTTP POST request callouts. Here's how you can do it:

1. Log in to your IBM Cloud account.
2. Open the Watson Assistant service.
3. Click on your Watson Assistant instance.
4. In the dialog where you want to add the webhook, click on "Webhooks".
5. In the URL field, add the URL for the external application. For example, let's say we want to call the Language Translator service, we can specify the URL for our service instance: `https://api.us-south.language-translator.watson.cloud.ibm.com/v3/translate?version=2018-05-01`.
6. If the external application requires any headers or authentication credentials, you can add them in the Headers section.
7. Click "Save" to save your webhook details.

## Step 2: Adding a Webhook Callout to a Dialog Node

Now that we have defined our webhook, we can add a webhook callout to a dialog node. This callout will be triggered whenever the node is triggered during a conversation with a user. Here's how you can do it:

1. Find the dialog node where you want to add a callout.
2. Click to open the dialog node and then click on "Customize".
3. Scroll down to the webhook section and set the "Call out to webhooks / actions" switch to "On".
4. Select "Call a webhook" and click "Apply".
5. Add any data that you want to pass to the external application as key-value pairs in the Parameters section.
6. Customize the conditional responses section based on the success or failure of the webhook call. You can edit the responses and add more conditional responses.
7. Click the "X" to close the node and save your changes.

## Step 3: Calling an IBM Cloud Functions Web Action

If you want to call an IBM Cloud Functions web action from your Watson Assistant, you can follow these steps:

1. In the URL field of the Webhooks section, add the URL for the external application you want to call. For example, if you want to call a Cloud Functions web action, specify the URL for the public web action: `https://us-south.functions.cloud.ibm.com/api/v1/web/my_org_dev/default/Hello%20World.json`.
2. If the external application requires any headers, such as authentication headers, specify them in the Headers section.
3. Follow the same steps as in Step 2 to add a webhook callout to a dialog node.

## Step 4: Updating output.generic with a Webhook

You can use a webhook to update the `output.generic` field in your Watson Assistant and provide dynamic responses. Here's how you can do it:

1. Follow the steps in Step 2 to add a webhook callout to a dialog node.
2. In the conditional responses section, customize the responses based on the webhook callout result. You can use SpEL expressions to extract specific values from the webhook response.
3. Save your changes.

## Calling the Language Translator Service with the Webhook

In this example, let's assume we want to use the Language Translator service to translate user input from English to Spanish. Here's how you can configure the webhook request:

1. In the "Headers" section, add a header named "Content-Type" with the value "application/json" to specify the request format.
2. In the "Parameters" section, add two key-value pairs:
   - Key: "model_id" Value: "en-es" (specifies English to Spanish translation)
   - Key: "text" Value: "<? input.text ?>" (passes the user's input text to the service)

Once you have configured the webhook request, you can customize the responses in the conditional responses section based on the webhook callout result. For example, you can use a response like "Your translation to Spanish: $webhook_result_1.translations[0].translation".

Remember to save your changes and test your Watson Assistant with the webhook integration. You should see the user input being translated to Spanish based on the Language Translator service response.

That's it! You have successfully learned how to create a Watson Assistant with a simple webhook and call external services like the Language Translator service. Feel free to explore more advanced webhook functionalities and experiment with different use cases.

Happy building!
